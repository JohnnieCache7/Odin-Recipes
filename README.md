The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This is purely for practical purposes to brush up on small skills. 

There are 3 web pages apart from the index home page.

Each recipe page will have an image of the food, decription, unordered and ordered lists of the ingredients and steps to make said recipe.
